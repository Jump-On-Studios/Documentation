## 2. Usage

You can access the advanced camera in three different ways, giving you flexibility in how you launch the tool.

* **Hotkey**: Press the default key, `F6`, to instantly open the camera interface.
* **Pause Menu**: Open the game's pause menu and select the "Photo Mode" option.
* **Command**: Type the `/openPhotoMode` command into the chat.

### Basic Controls

These are the fundamental controls for operating the camera in any mode.

* **Move Camera**: Use `Z`, `Q`, `S`, `D` for horizontal movement, `SPACE` to move up, and `L CTRL` to move down.
* **Adjust Speed**: Scroll the **mouse wheel** to increase or decrease the camera's movement speed.
* **Toggle UI**: Press `C` to hide or show the user interface. This is perfect for taking clean screenshots in Photo Mode or recording footage in Video Mode.
* **Switch Mode**: Press `TAB` to switch between **Photo Mode** and **Video Mode**.
* **Advanced Options**: Press `A` to open the advanced options panel, which contains detailed settings organized into tabs.
* **Exit**: Longpress `ESC` to close the camera interface.

---

### Advanced Options

Pressing `A` opens a menu with detailed controls, allowing you to fine-tune every aspect of your shot.

:::: tabs

::: tab ðŸ“· Lens
The **Lens** tab allows you to adjust the camera's optical properties.

* **In Photo Mode**, you have full control over the **Field of View (FOV)**, **Exposure**, **Focus Distance**, and **Depth of Field (DOF)** to create cinematic, professional-looking stills.
* **In Video Mode**, due to a `SPLINE_CAMERA` limitation, you can only adjust the **FOV**.
:::

::: tab âœ¨ Filters
In both Photo and Video modes, the **Filters** tab lets you apply a visual filter to your scene. You can select from a list of available filters and use a slider to adjust its **strength** or intensity.
:::

::: tab ðŸŽ¥ Traveling
The **Traveling** tab is exclusive to **Video Mode** and is used to create smooth, pre-programmed camera movements.

First, you must add waypoints to define the camera's path. While in Video Mode, two new prompts will appear:
* **Add Waypoint (`N`)**: Adds a new point to the camera's path at its current position.
* **Preview Traveling (`J`)**: Plays the camera movement along the defined waypoint track.

Once you have at least two waypoints, a **timeline** will appear at the top of the screen. The Traveling tab allows you to:
* Set the **smoothing function** used by the spline camera for fluid transitions.
* Define the total **traveling time** (in milliseconds) for the entire sequence.
* Toggle a **letterbox** effect for a cinematic aspect ratio.
* View, reorder, view, edit, or delete waypoints from the waypoint list.
:::

::: tab ðŸ’¾ Presets
The **Presets** tab allows you to save and load your configurations. Presets for Photo Mode and Video Mode are saved separately; you must be in the correct mode to see its associated presets.

* **Photo Mode Preset**: Saves your **Lens** and **Filter** configurations.
* **Video Mode Preset**: Saves your **Lens**, **Filter**, and complete **Traveling** configuration (including waypoints, timing, and smoothing).

You can also share your work easily:
* **Export**: Select a saved preset and click "Export". The preset's code will be copied to your clipboard.
* **Import**: Click "Import" and paste a shared code to add a new preset to your list.

Presets are saved locally on your client using RedM's Key-Value Pair (KVP) system. This means your presets are unique to you on the server and are not shared with other players by default.

## 3. Configuration

The Advanced Camera script is highly configurable to suit your server's needs. Configuration is split between the main settings and language translations.

- **Base configuration**: `config.lua` - Contains all default settings
- **Your customizations**: `overwriteConfig.lua` - Override only the specific settings you want to change
- **Language file**: `lang.lua` - Contains all default translations
- **Your translations**: `overwriteLang.lua` - Override only the specific translations you want to change

:::warning
Rather than editing the original config files directly, you should make your changes in `overwriteConfig.lua` and `overwriteLang.lua`. This way, you can easily update the script without losing your customizations.

### Configuration File

::: tab Configuration properties

| Property                                    | Default Value   | Description                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Config.openKey`                            | `F6`            | Keybind to open the advanced camera, [find all the controls here](https://docs.jumpon-studios.com/jo_libs/modules/raw-keys/client#keys). Set it to `false` to disable it.  |
| `Config.openFromPauseMenu`                  | `true`          | Can the camera mode be opened via the native prompt inside the game pause menu. Set it to `false` to disable it.  |
| `Config.openCommandName`                    | `openPhotoMode` |The name of the command to open the script (ex: /openPhotoMode). Set it to `false` to disable it.   |

::: tab Configuration file

```lua
Config = {}

Config.openKey = "F6" -- set it to false to disabled
Config.openFromPauseMenu = true -- set it to false to disabled
Config.openCommandName = "openPhotoMode" -- set it to false to disabled
```

:::

::::

### Language Configuration

The script supports full translation through the language system. To override any text in the script:

1. Find the key you want to change in `lang.lua`
2. Add only that key to `overwriteLang.lua` with your new text

Example:

```lua
-- In overwriteLang.lua
Lang.photoMode = "Photo Mode"
Lang.videoMode = "Video Mode"
Lang.failedToDelete = "Failed to delete preset"
```

Available translation categories include:
- General UI & Common Terms
- Menu Titles & Subtitles
- Prompts & Labels
- Input Prompts
- Notifications & Messages (success and error messages)

:::tip ðŸ’¡Only change the key you need to translate
You only need to include the specific keys you want to change in `overwriteLang.lua`. Don't copy the entire language file.

## 4. For Developers

### Filters

[Filters](/DeveloperResources/filters) allow you to modify data or control permissions during script execution. Introduced in `v1.2.0`, filters provide a **synchronous** way to intercept and modify script behavior at specific points, unlike events which are asynchronous.
  
Below is a complete list of all available filters in the jo_advanced_camera script.

#### <Badge type="client" text="Client" /> canOpenAdvancedCamera
Controls who can open the advanced camera script.

```lua
-- @param canUse - boolean indicating if the action is allowed by default
-- @param source - serverID of the player
exports.jo_advanced_camera:registerFilter('canOpenAdvancedCamera', function(canUse, source)
    -- Example: Only allow admins
    local isAdmin = exports.your_permission_system:isAdmin(source)
    return isAdmin
end)
```

:::details Example of job lock for VORP
```lua
AllowedJobs = {
    photograph = true,
    admin = true,
}

exports.jo_advanced_camera:registerFilter('canOpenAdvancedCamera', function(canUse, source)
    local job = jo.framework:getJob(source)
    if AllowedJobs[job] then
      return canUse
    else
      jo.notif.rightError("You don't have the right job to use the camera script")
      return false
    end
end)
```
