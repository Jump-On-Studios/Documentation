## 1. Installation
jo_housing works on all frameworks compatible with jo_libs ([the list](/jo_libs/modules/framework-bridge/#compatible-frameworks)).

To install jo_housing :
- Download the library: [jo_libs](https://github.com/Jump-On-Studios/RedM-jo_libs/releases/latest/download/jo_libs.zip)
- Unzip the folder and drop it in your resource folder
- Download jo_housing from your [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants?search=stable)
- Unzip the folder and drop it in your resource folder
- Add this ensure in your server.cfg
  - `ensure jo_libs`
  - `ensure jo_housing`

Congratulation, the **Housing** script is ready to be used!
:::warning

## 3. Script Configuration

The Housing script is highly configurable to suit your server's needs. Configuration is split between the main settings and language translations.

:::warning
Rather than editing the original config files directly, you should make your changes in `overwriteConfig.lua` and `overwriteLang.lua`. This way, you can easily update the script without losing your customizations.
:::

### Configuration Files

- **Base configuration**: `shared/config.lua` - Contains all default settings
- **Your customizations**: `overwriteConfig.lua` - Override only the specific settings you want to change
- **Language file**: `shared/lang.lua` - Contains all default translations
- **Your translations**: `overwriteLang.lua` - Override only the specific translations you want to change



#### Distance Settings

```lua
-- Distance in meters at which to show interaction prompts
Config.distanceShowHousePrompt = 2.5           -- Show house menu prompt
Config.distanceShowStablePrompt = 2.0          -- Show stable prompt 
Config.distanceShowWagonPrompt = 2.0           -- Show wagon prompt

-- Interior interaction distances
Config.distanceShowInteriorDoorPrompt = 1.0    -- Show interior door prompt
Config.distanceShowInteriorStoragePrompt = 1.0 -- Show storage prompt
Config.distanceShowInteriorDressingPrompt = 1.0 -- Show dressing prompt
```

#### Feature Settings

```lua
-- Knocking on doors
Config.knockNotificationDuration = 5000  -- Duration of knock notification in ms

-- Payment options
Config.allowPayingInGold = true  -- Enable/disable gold as payment method

-- Rent settings
Config.rentMaxDays = 10          -- Maximum number of days for daily rent period
Config.rentMaxWeek = 2           -- Maximum number of weeks for weekly rent period
Config.extraDaysAllowedBeforeExpulsion = 1.0 -- Grace period after rent expires (in days)
Config.allowRentExtensionAnytime = true   -- Allow rent extension before expiration
```

#### Hook Functions

These functions connect the housing script to other resources on your server:



```lua
Config.openWardrobe = function()
    -- Replace with your wardrobe resource
    exports["kd_clothingstore"]:openWardrobe()
end
```



```lua
Config.openStable = function(stableLocation, stableSpawnLocation)
    -- Replace with your stable resource
    -- Parameters provide the coordinates for the stable and spawn locations
    exports["your_stable_resource"]:openStable(stableLocation, stableSpawnLocation)
end
```



```lua
Config.openWagon = function(wagonLocation, wagonSpawnLocation)
    -- Replace with your wagon resource
    -- Parameters provide the coordinates for the wagon and spawn locations
    exports["your_wagon_resource"]:openWagon(wagonLocation, wagonSpawnLocation)
end
```

#### Keyboard Keys

You can customize all key bindings used in the script:

```lua
Config.keys = {
    openHouseMenu = "E",         -- Open house menu
    buyHouse = "ENTER",          -- Buy a house
    buyGold = "G",               -- Pay with gold
    enterVisitMode = "R",        -- Enter visit mode
    leaveHouse = "X",            -- Leave the house
    
    -- Building mode
    addFurnitures = "A",         -- Add furniture
    editFurnitures = "E",        -- Edit furniture
    deleteFurniture = "DELETE",  -- Delete furniture
    leaveBuildMode = "X",        -- Exit build mode
    
    -- Many more keys available in the config.lua file
}
```

#### House Categories and Interiors

##### Categories

Define different types of houses with furniture limits:

```lua
Config.houseCategories = {
    big = {
        label = "Big Houses",
        maxFurnitures = 200
    },
    medium = {
        label = "Medium Houses",
        maxFurnitures = 150
    },
    small = {
        label = "Small Houses",
        maxFurnitures = 100
    },
    -- Add your own categories here
}
```

##### Interiors

Define the available interior types with their locations:

```lua
Config.houseInteriors = {
    int_1 = {
        label = "Interior 1",          -- Display name
        category = "big",              -- From houseCategories
        doorLocation = vec4(-881.378, -1656.110, 67.890, 205.622)  -- Door coordinates (x,y,z,heading)
    },
    bakery = {
        label = "Bakery",
        category = "small",
        doorLocation = vec4(-3721.501, -2515.817, -11.268, 92.513),
        -- Optional: frozenDoors - doors that should be frozen in the interior
        frozenDoors = {
            {
                model = "p_door13x",
                location = vec3(-3720.73, -2516.28, -12.28)
            }
        },
    },
    -- Add your own interiors here
}
```

#### Furniture Configuration

##### Furniture Categories

Create organization categories for furniture:

```lua
Config.furnituresCategories = {
    chairs = {
        name = "Chairs"
    },
    tables = {
        name = "Tables"
    },
    storage = {
        name = "Storage"
    },
    -- Add your own categories here
}
```

#### Furniture Items

Define the individual furniture pieces players can buy:

```lua
Config.furnitures = {
    {
        name = "Chaise 01",           -- Display name
        category = "chairs",          -- From furnituresCategories
        model = "p_chairwicker03x",   -- Game model
        price = {
            money = 100,              -- Price in dollars
            gold = 1                  -- Price in gold
        }
    },
    {
        name = "Barrel 01",
        category = "misc",
        model = "p_chickenbarrel01x",
        price = {
            money = 100,
            gold = 1
        }
    },
    -- Add your own furniture here
}
```

### Language Configuration

The script supports full translation through the language system. To override any text in the script:

1. Find the key you want to change in `shared/lang.lua`
2. Add only that key to `overwriteLang.lua` with your new text

Example:

```lua
-- In overwriteLang.lua
Lang.houseManagerTitle = "Property Manager"
Lang.buyHouseMoney = "Purchase with Cash"
Lang.rentPaidSuccessfully = "Rent paid successfully! Welcome home."
```

Available translation categories include:
- General UI & Common Terms
- Menu Titles & Subtitles
- Prompts & Labels
- Input Prompts
- Notifications & Messages (success and error messages)

:::tip
You only need to include the specific keys you want to change in `overwriteLang.lua`. Don't copy the entire language file.
:::

## 4. For Developers

### Filters

[Filters](/DeveloperResources/filters) allow you to modify data or control permissions during script execution. Introduced in `v1.2.0`, filters provide a **synchronous** way to intercept and modify script behavior at specific points, unlike events which are asynchronous.

#### Using Filters

```lua
-- Register a filter that intercepts and potentially modifies a value
exports.jo_housing:registerFilter('filterName', function(value, otherParams)
    -- Modify the value or check permissions
    return value -- Must return the modified/original value
end)
```
