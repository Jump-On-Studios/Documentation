## 3. Script Configuration

The Housing script is highly configurable to suit your server's needs. Configuration is split between the main settings and language translations.

:::warning
Rather than editing the original config files directly, you should make your changes in `overwriteConfig.lua` and `overwriteLang.lua`. This way, you can easily update the script without losing your customizations.
:::

### Configuration Files

- **Base configuration**: `shared/config.lua` - Contains all default settings
- **Your customizations**: `overwriteConfig.lua` - Override only the specific settings you want to change
- **Language file**: `shared/lang.lua` - Contains all default translations
- **Your translations**: `overwriteLang.lua` - Override only the specific translations you want to change

### Language Configuration

The script supports full translation through the language system. To override any text in the script:

1. Find the key you want to change in `shared/lang.lua`
2. Add only that key to `overwriteLang.lua` with your new text

Example:

```lua
-- In overwriteLang.lua
Lang.houseManagerTitle = "Property Manager"
Lang.buyHouseMoney = "Purchase with Cash"
Lang.rentPaidSuccessfully = "Rent paid successfully! Welcome home."
```

Available translation categories include:
- General UI & Common Terms
- Menu Titles & Subtitles
- Prompts & Labels
- Input Prompts
- Notifications & Messages (success and error messages)

:::tip
You only need to include the specific keys you want to change in `overwriteLang.lua`. Don't copy the entire language file.

## 4. For Developers

### Filters

[Filters](/DeveloperResources/filters) allow you to modify data or control permissions during script execution. Introduced in `v1.2.0`, filters provide a **synchronous** way to intercept and modify script behavior at specific points, unlike events which are asynchronous.

#### Using Filters

```lua
-- Register a filter that intercepts and potentially modifies a value
exports.jo_housing:registerFilter('filterName', function(value, otherParams)
    -- Modify the value or check permissions
    return value -- Must return the modified/original value
end)
```
