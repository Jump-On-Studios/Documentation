## 1. Installation
jo_housing works on all frameworks compatible with jo_libs ([the list](/jo_libs/modules/framework-bridge/#compatible-frameworks)).

To install jo_housing :
- Download the library: [jo_libs](https://github.com/Jump-On-Studios/RedM-jo_libs/releases/latest/download/jo_libs.zip)
- Unzip the folder and drop it in your resource folder
- Download jo_housing from your [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants?search=stable)
- Unzip the folder and drop it in your resource folder
- Add this ensure in your server.cfg
  - `ensure jo_libs`
  - `ensure jo_housing`
- This script uses the [raw keys](/jo_libs/modules/raw-keys/) module, if you have any problem with the prompts you should [set the keyboard layout](/jo_libs/modules/raw-keys/client#setting-keyboard-layout)
- If you want to use `Config.enableKeyMode=true` ([see explainations here](#general-settings)), **you must add House Key Item**:<br> Configure the house key item in your framework's item system (referenced in [`Config.items.houseKey`](#items-and-pricing)) <br>
Examples :

:::: tabs

::: tab Example : VORP Framework
Add this item configuration to your VORP database items table:

```json
{
    "table": "items",
    "rows": [
        {
            "item": "house_key",
            "label": "House Key",
            "limit": 10,
            "can_remove": 1,
            "type": "item_standard",
            "usable": 0,
            "groupId": 1,
            "metadata": "{}",
            "desc": "A house key",
            "degradation": 0,
            "weight": 0.10
        }
    ]
}
```
:::

::: tab Example : RSG Framework V2
Add this item configuration to your RSG items file:

```lua
house_key = { 
    name = "house_key", 
    label = "A house key", 
    weight = 0, 
    type = "item", 
    image = "your_key_image.png", 
    unique = true, 
    useable = false, 
    shouldClose = false, 
    description = "" 
}
```

Congratulation, the **Housing** script is ready to be used!
:::warning
Be sure you have oxmysql ensure in your server.cfg
:::
:::tip üí° Tables creation
The script automatically creates all necessary database tables during its first startup
:::

## 2. Usage

### Create / Update / Delete houses

The housing system provides an admin interface to manage properties on your server.

:::tip üí° Permission Control
By default, any player can use the `/houseManager` command to create and manage houses. You can restrict access by using the [`canUseHouseManagerCommand`](#canusehousemanagercommand) filter to implement your own permission system (admin-only, specific roles, etc.).
:::

:::: tabs

::: tab üî® Creating a House
**Creating a House:**
1. Use the command `/houseManager` to open the housing management menu
2. Select "Create a new house"

   - **Category**: Choose from available interior categories (Houses, Shacks, Manors, etc.)
   - **Rooms Amount**: Select the number of rooms for your chosen category
   - **Interior**: Pick a specific interior from the filtered options based on category and rooms
   - **Shell Location**: Place the interior shell in the world (use visit mode to preview)
   - **Front Door Location**: Move the entrance marker (automatically set at your position when creating)
   - **Contract Type**: Choose between one-time sale or rent
     - If rent: Select daily or weekly rent periods
   - **Price**: Set money and gold prices using the designated prompt keys
   - **Features**: Configure available features:
     - **Stable**: Enable/disable horse storage
       - Stable Location: Place the stable interaction marker

**Key Mode Enabled (`enableKeyMode = true`):**
- Players receive physical key items when they buy houses
- House owners can purchase additional keys to give to other players
- House owners can change locks, making all existing keys obsolete
- Players must carry their key item to enter their house

**Key Mode Disabled (`enableKeyMode = false`):**
- No physical key items exist in the game
- House owners manage an access list of players who can enter
- Access is controlled through the house management menu
- Players don't need to carry any items to enter their house

This setting is configured in your server's `Config.enableKeyMode` and affects all houses on your server.
:::

## 3. Interiors Gallery

Browse through all available interior options for your housing system. This gallery showcases the complete collection of interiors you can choose from when creating houses using the `/houseManager` command. Use the category filter to narrow down options by interior type (Houses, Shacks, Manors, Flats, Rock Shacks, or Worker buildings) and the rooms filter to find interiors with your desired number of rooms. 

<InteriorGallery />

## 4. Script Configuration

The Housing script is highly configurable to suit your server's needs. Configuration is split between the main settings and language translations.

:::warning
Rather than editing the original config files directly, you should make your changes in `overwriteConfig.lua` and `overwriteLang.lua`. This way, you can easily update the script without losing your customizations.
:::

### Configuration Files

- **Base configuration**: `shared/config.lua` - Contains all default settings
- **Your customizations**: `overwriteConfig.lua` - Override only the specific settings you want to change
- **Language file**: `shared/lang.lua` - Contains all default translations
- **Your translations**: `overwriteLang.lua` - Override only the specific translations you want to change

### Language Configuration

The script supports full translation through the language system. To override any text in the script:

1. Find the key you want to change in `shared/lang.lua`
2. Add only that key to `overwriteLang.lua` with your new text

Example:

```lua
-- In overwriteLang.lua
Lang.houseManagerTitle = "Property Manager"
Lang.buyHouseMoney = "Purchase with Cash"
Lang.rentPaidSuccessfully = "Rent paid successfully! Welcome home."
```

Available translation categories include:
- General UI & Common Terms
- Menu Titles & Subtitles
- Prompts & Labels
- Input Prompts
- Notifications & Messages (success and error messages)

:::tip üí°Only change the key you need to translate
You only need to include the specific keys you want to change in `overwriteLang.lua`. Don't copy the entire language file.

## 5. FAQ

:::details It's raining in my house !
Weather effects (rain, snow) can appear inside interiors due to your framework's weather synchronization system. To fix this, you need to disable weather sync when players enter houses and re-enable it when they leave.

**Solution:**
Use the housing script's server actions to control your framework's weather sync:

```lua
-- Disable weather sync when entering a house
exports.jo_housing:registerAction('server:houseEntered', function(source, house, isVisiting)
    -- Example for different frameworks:
    
    -- VORP Framework
    TriggerClientEvent('vorp:updateWeatherSync', source, false)

:::details Can I add custom interiors ?
Yes! You can add your own custom interiors using the `customInteriors` filter. This allows you to integrate custom MLO interiors or propsets into the housing system.

**How to add custom interiors:**

```lua
-- In your server-side resource or in jo_housing itself
exports.jo_housing:registerFilter('customInteriors', function(customInteriors)
    -- Add your custom interiors
    customInteriors.my_custom_cabin = {
        entries = {
            vec4(2.022125, -0.556265, 1.696404, 91.094)  -- Main door spawn point (relative to interior origin)
        },
        propset = "my_custom_cabin",     -- Interior propset/MLO name
        category = "shack",              -- Interior category (house, shack, manor, flat, rock_shack, worker)
        numberRoom = 2,                  -- Number of rooms in the interior
        insideDoors = {                  -- Optional: Interior working doors configuration
            { 
                model = "p_door04x", 
                position = vec3(0.062589, -4.6552873, 0.738253) 
            }
        }
    }
    
    customInteriors.luxury_penthouse = {
        entries = {
            vec4(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 180.0)  -- Main door spawn point
        },
        propset = "luxury_penthouse_mlo",
        category = "manor",
        numberRoom = 8
        -- insideDoors is optional - omit if no working interior doors needed
    }
    
    return customInteriors
end)
```

**Configuration Tips:**
- Set furniture limits for your custom interiors in [`Config.interiorsMaxFurnitures`](#interior-configuration)
- Use `/houseManager` visit mode to test and preview your interior placement
- Interior categories affect available furniture limits and UI organization

:::details Can I add custom furnitures (props) ?
Yes! You can add custom furniture categories and props using the `customFurnitures` filter. This allows you to expand the available furniture options beyond the default categories.

**How to add custom furniture:**

```lua
-- In your server-side resource or in jo_housing itself
exports.jo_housing:registerFilter('customFurnitures', function(customFurnitures)
    -- Add your custom furniture categories
    customFurnitures.custom_electronics = {
        "p_tv01x",
        "p_radio01x", 
        "p_lamp_handheld01x",
        "p_phonograph01x"
    }
    
    customFurnitures.outdoor_furniture = {
        "p_bench05x",
        "p_campfire01x",
        "p_tent01x",
        "p_waterbarrel01x"
    }
    
    customFurnitures.western_decor = {
        "p_spittoon01x",
        "p_horseshoe01x",
        "p_banjo01x"
    }
    
    return customFurnitures
end)
```

**Don't forget to configure pricing:**
Add pricing for your custom categories in your `overwriteConfig.lua`:

```lua
-- Configure pricing for custom furniture categories
Config.furnituresCategoriesPrices.custom_electronics = {
    money = 250,
    gold = 3
}

Config.furnituresCategoriesPrices.outdoor_furniture = {
    money = 75,
    gold = 1
}

-- You can also set specific prices for individual props
Config.furnituresPrices.p_tv01x = {
    money = 500,
    gold = 5
}
```

:::details The prompts are not working !
If prompts aren't appearing or responding, this is usually related to key binding or keyboard layout issues. Here are the most common solutions:

**Primary Solution - Keyboard Layout:**
This script uses the [raw keys](/jo_libs/modules/raw-keys/) module. If you have problems with prompts, [set the keyboard layout](/jo_libs/modules/raw-keys/client#setting-keyboard-layout) properly.

**Additional Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check for Key Conflicts:**
   - Other resources might be using the same keys
   - Review your [`Config.keys`](#key-bindings) settings in `overwriteConfig.lua`
   - Try changing conflicting keys to different bindings

2. **Verify Distance Settings:**
   - Make sure you're close enough to interact with objects
   - Check [`Config.distanceShowHousePrompt`](#distance-settings) and related distance settings
   - Default house prompt distance is 2.5 meters

3. **Framework Compatibility:**
   - Ensure your framework is [compatible with jo_libs](/jo_libs/modules/framework-bridge/#compatible-frameworks)
   - Check that jo_libs is properly installed and started before jo_housing

#### Using Filters

```lua
-- Register a filter that intercepts and potentially modifies a value
exports.jo_housing:registerFilter('filterName', function(value, otherParams)
    -- Modify the value or check permissions
    return value -- Must return the modified/original value

:::tip üí° Interior Configuration
- Configure furniture limits for your custom interiors using [`Config.interiorsMaxFurnitures`](#interior-configuration) or category limits with [`Config.interiorsCategoriesMaxFurnitures`](#interior-configuration)
- Test your interior coordinates thoroughly - use `/houseManager` visit mode to preview placement
- Interior categories affect available furniture limits and UI organization

```lua
-- In your overwriteConfig.lua
Config.interiorsMaxFurnitures.my_custom_cabin = 150
Config.interiorsCategoriesMaxFurnitures.luxury = 300  -- If you add a custom category
```
