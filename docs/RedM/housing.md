## 1. Installation
jo_housing works on all frameworks compatible with jo_libs ([the list](/jo_libs/modules/framework-bridge/#compatible-frameworks)).

To install jo_housing :
- Download the library: [jo_libs](https://github.com/Jump-On-Studios/RedM-jo_libs/releases/latest/download/jo_libs.zip)
- Unzip the folder and drop it in your resource folder
- Download jo_housing from your [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants?search=stable)
- Unzip the folder and drop it in your resource folder
- Add this ensure in your server.cfg
  - `ensure jo_libs`
  - `ensure jo_housing`
- If you want to use `Config.enableKeyMode=true` ([see explainations here](#general-settings)), **you must add House Key Item**:<br> Configure the house key item in your framework's item system (referenced in [`Config.items.houseKey`](#items-and-pricing)) <br>
Examples :

:::: tabs

::: tab VORP Framework
Add this item configuration to your VORP database items table:

```json
{
    "table": "items",
    "rows": [
        {
            "item": "house_key",
            "label": "House Key",
            "limit": 10,
            "can_remove": 1,
            "type": "item_standard",
            "usable": 0,
            "groupId": 1,
            "metadata": "{}",
            "desc": "A house key",
            "degradation": 0,
            "weight": 0.10
        }
    ]
}
```
:::

::: tab RSG Framework V2
Add this item configuration to your RSG items file:

```lua
house_key = { 
    name = "house_key", 
    label = "A house key", 
    weight = 0, 
    type = "item", 
    image = "your_key_image.png", 
    unique = true, 
    useable = false, 
    shouldClose = false, 
    description = "" 
}
```

- House owners can purchase additional keys to give to other players
- House owners can change locks, making all existing keys obsolete
- Players must carry their key item to enter their house

**Key Mode Disabled (`enableKeyMode = false`):**
- No physical key items exist in the game
- House owners manage an access list of players who can enter
- Access is controlled through the house management menu
- Players don't need to carry any items to enter their house

This setting is configured in your server's `Config.enableKeyMode` and affects all houses on your server.

## 4. Script Configuration

The Housing script is highly configurable to suit your server's needs. Configuration is split between the main settings and language translations.

:::warning
Rather than editing the original config files directly, you should make your changes in `overwriteConfig.lua` and `overwriteLang.lua`. This way, you can easily update the script without losing your customizations.
:::

### Configuration Files

- **Base configuration**: `shared/config.lua` - Contains all default settings
- **Your customizations**: `overwriteConfig.lua` - Override only the specific settings you want to change
- **Language file**: `shared/lang.lua` - Contains all default translations
- **Your translations**: `overwriteLang.lua` - Override only the specific translations you want to change

### Language Configuration

The script supports full translation through the language system. To override any text in the script:

1. Find the key you want to change in `shared/lang.lua`
2. Add only that key to `overwriteLang.lua` with your new text

Example:

```lua
-- In overwriteLang.lua
Lang.houseManagerTitle = "Property Manager"
Lang.buyHouseMoney = "Purchase with Cash"
Lang.rentPaidSuccessfully = "Rent paid successfully! Welcome home."
```

Available translation categories include:
- General UI & Common Terms
- Menu Titles & Subtitles
- Prompts & Labels
- Input Prompts
- Notifications & Messages (success and error messages)

:::tip
You only need to include the specific keys you want to change in `overwriteLang.lua`. Don't copy the entire language file.

## 5. For Developers

### Actions

Actions are one of the two types of Hooks. They provide a way for running a function at a specific point in the execution of scripts. Callback functions for an Action do not return anything back to the calling Action hook. They are the counterpart to Filters.

#### Available Actions

Below is a complete list of all available actions in the jo_housing script. All these actions are **server-side**.

##### House Management Actions

#### <Badge type="server" text="Server" /> server:houseManagerCommandUsed
Triggered when a player uses the `/houseManager` command.

```lua
-- @param source - serverID of the player who used the command
exports.jo_housing:registerAction('server:houseManagerCommandUsed', function(source)
    -- Your code here
end)
```

#### <Badge type="server" text="Server" /> server:houseLocationMenuOpened
Triggered when a player opens the house location menu.

```lua
-- @param source - serverID of the player
-- @param houses - array of nearby houses
exports.jo_housing:registerAction('server:houseLocationMenuOpened', function(source, houses)
    -- Your code here
end)
```

#### <Badge type="server" text="Server" /> server:houseBought
Triggered when a player successfully purchases a house.

```lua
-- @param source - serverID of the buyer
-- @param house - the house object that was purchased
exports.jo_housing:registerAction('server:houseBought', function(source, house)
    -- Your code here
end)
```

#### <Badge type="server" text="Server" /> server:houseEntered
Triggered when a player enters a house.

```lua
-- @param source - serverID of the player
-- @param house - the house object being entered
-- @param isVisiting - boolean indicating if the player is visiting
exports.jo_housing:registerAction('server:houseEntered', function(source, house, isVisiting)
    -- Your code here
end)
```

#### <Badge type="server" text="Server" /> server:houseLeft
Triggered when a player leaves a house.

```lua
-- @param source - serverID of the player
-- @param house - the house object being left
exports.jo_housing:registerAction('server:houseLeft', function(source, house)
    -- Your code here
end)
```

#### <Badge type="server" text="Server" /> server:houseCreated
Triggered when a new house is created .

```lua
-- @param source - serverID of the player who created the house
-- @param house - the newly created house object

### Filters

[Filters](/DeveloperResources/filters) allow you to modify data or control permissions during script execution. Introduced in `v1.2.0`, filters provide a **synchronous** way to intercept and modify script behavior at specific points, unlike events which are asynchronous.

#### Using Filters

```lua
-- Register a filter that intercepts and potentially modifies a value
exports.jo_housing:registerFilter('filterName', function(value, otherParams)
    -- Modify the value or check permissions
    return value -- Must return the modified/original value
end)
```
