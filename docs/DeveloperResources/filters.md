# Filters

**Filters** are one of the two types of [Hooks](hooks).

They provide a way for functions to modify data during the execution of scripts. They are the counterpart to Actions.

Unlike [Actions](actions), filters are meant to work in an isolated manner, and should never have side effects such as affecting global variables and output. Filters expect to have something returned back to them.

## Add Filter
The process of adding a filter includes two steps.

First, you need to create a Callback function which will be called when the filter is run. Second, you need to add your Callback function to a hook which will perform the calling of the function.
The script determines the order that callback functions are run based on two things:
* By manually setting the priority.
* If two callback functions are registered for the same hook with the same priority, they will be run in the order that they were registered to the hook.

A Filter with a priority of 11 will run after a filter with a priority of 10; and a filter with a priority of 9 will run before a filter with a priority of 10.


You will use the registerFilter() function, passing at least two parameters:

1. `string $hook_name` which is the name of the filter you’re hooking to, and
2. `callable $callback` the name of your callback function.
3. `(optional) int $priority` the priority of the filter (default value is 10)

The example below will run when the `kd_stable:client:menuTitle` filter is executed in *kd_stable* script with a priority = 10.

```lua
function filter_menu_title(title)
  return "The " .. title .. " was filtered"
end

exports.kd_stable:registerFilter('kd_stable:client:menuTitle', filter_menu_title, 10)

```
Lets say we have a menu title, “My horses”, the above example will modify it to be “The My horses was filtered”.

You can refer to the script docs for a list of available hooks.

As you gain more experience, looking through Open Source code will allow you to find the most appropriate hook.
