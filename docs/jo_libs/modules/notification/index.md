# Notification

Notification is a module to offer functions to display various types of native-style notifications on the player's screen.

## Include Notification in your script

1. To use the Notification library, just add the initiator as a shared script inside of your `fxmanifest.lua` file.
```lua
shared_scripts {
  '@jo_libs/init.lua'
}
```
2. Add the Notification module inside the `fxmanifest.lua` (in lowercase)
```lua
jo_libs {
  'notification',
}
```
You can now use the library inside of your resource with the `jo.notification` global variable.
