```lua
Config = {}

Config.command = "wheellock" --put false to disable it
Config.maxTimeToMove = 7000 --max duration to go near the vehicle
Config.debug = false --display debug message

-- Overwrite the default placement of the wheel lock
Config.offsets = {
  [GetHashKey('adder')] = {
    wheel_lr = vector4(-0.125,0.0,0.0,-180.0),
    wheel_rr = vector4(-0.125,0.0,0.0,-180.0),
    wheel_lf = vector4(-0.125,0.0,0.0,-180.0),
    wheel_lr = vector4(-0.125,0.0,0.0,-180.0),
  }
  default = {
    all = vector4(-0.125,0.0,0.0,-180.0)
  },
}

-- Fire when player start taking the wheel lock
-- @param vehicle The vehicle ID where the wheellock was removed
-- @param wheellockObj The wheel lock object

Config.takeWheellock = function(vehicle)
  Config.message(Lang.takeWheellock)

-- SERVER SIDE
----------------------------------

-- Use to restrick the script to specific players 
-- return true if player can use wheellock, else return false
Config.canUseWheellock = function(source)
  return true
end
```
## 4. For developer
Spawn the wheel lock on car without player animation :
```lua
-- @param vehNet : Server ID of the vehicle
-- @param boneName : Name of the bone where the wheel lock is
-- @side : Client side
TriggerEvent("kd_wheellock:addLockedCars", vehNet, 0, boneName)
```
Use event to put/remove the wheel lock :
```lua
-- @side : Client side
TriggerEvent('kd_wheellock:action') -- Put or remove the wheel lock
TriggerEvent('kd_wheellock:actionPut') -- Only Put the wheel lock
TriggerEvent('kd_wheellock:actionRemove') -- Only Remove the wheel lock
```

end
```
### <Badge type="qb" text="QBcore" /> Restrict the wheellock with job
